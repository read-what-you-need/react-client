                            <li>How long does it usually take for the results to show up ?</li>
                            <p>It can take anywhere between 10 seconds to 30 seconds, given the servers are not overloaded with requests.</p>

                            <li>What does 20% loaded in the results page mean ?</li>
                            <p>It means only 20% of the pdf is scanned uniformly and results are shown from that. This 10% limit on pdf is set, mainly because this a demo version to test the product.</p>

                            <li>Will my pdf be stored ?</li>
                            <p>The pdf is not stored. Only the encodings of the pdf that are used to serve smart results will be stored till tonight, after which they will be deleted.</p>

                            <li>How to get 100% results shown for a pdf?</li>
                            <p>If handful of people are interested to obtain full results, then we can start to rollout features that serve those needs.</p>

                            <li>Why cannot we share the results page link to our friends ?</li>
                            <p>This is just a demo test product, if more people are interested, we will work on rolling out this feature too. Let us know about it by filling out the feedback form ðŸ˜„ !</p>

                            <li>Why use this?</li>
                            <p>It mainly originates to discover nuggets of gold that lay hidden within books and access them quickly.</p>

                            <li>How does this work ?</li>
                            <p>In the backend there's a simple semantic search that takes place on the sentence embeddings computed on the sentences from the whole pdf. The emebeddings are generated from a sentence transformer library built on top of hugging face. Citation below</p>

                            <li>Where was this created ?</li>
                            <p>This was created in Manipal under some shade of coconut trees <i class="twa  twa-palm-tree"></i> and a mix of beach vibes <i class="twa twa-beach-with-umbrella"></i></p>
